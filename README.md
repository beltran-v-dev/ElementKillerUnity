# ElementKillerUnity

Element Killer is a 2D platform video game in which our main character has to
defeat different enemies and reach the end of the level. To do so, the player has to
combine different elements such as fire, water, and plant to complete the level in just
over a minute.

In this repository you'll find the scripts used to make the game 

My tasks: This project was done by 4 people; I was the project manager and one of the
programmers. As a project manager, I managed Trello, sprints, milestones, and the
communication between team members. As a programmer, my main tasks were
character movement and AI (enemies).
